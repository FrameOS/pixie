# This is the FrameOS fork of Pixie

Upstream lives at [treeform/pixie](https://github.com/treeform/pixie); its
README follows below and still describes the library accurately. This fork adds
what [FrameOS](https://github.com/FrameOS/frameos) needs to draw pictures on
hardware that does not have room for them.

A FrameOS scene renders on a Raspberry Pi Zero with 512MB of RAM, or on an
ESP32-S3 with 8MB of PSRAM and about 100KB of internal heap. Upstream pixie
decodes an image by allocating the finished image plus every intermediate the
codec wants, which is the right trade on a desktop and the difference between
rendering and rebooting on a frame. Everything below follows from that, plus a
few features FrameOS wanted along the way.

Nothing here removes or renames upstream API: this is a superset, and it tracks
upstream. `-d:frameosEmbedded` only changes defaults (a conservative decode
budget), never behaviour you did not ask for.

## What this fork adds

**A memory budget decoders actually respect** (`pixie/decodebudget.nim`).
`setDecodeBudgetBytes` sets a per-decode ceiling covering intermediates *and*
output; decoders plan their allocations before making them and raise a catchable
`PixieError` when the plan does not fit, instead of taking the process down with
them. `0` means unlimited, which is the default on hosts. An application that
knows its live free memory can refresh the budget before every decode.

**Decoding straight into the size you want.** `decodeImageScaled`,
`decodeImageScaledInto` and `readImageScaled` take a target size and a fit mode
(`fitStretch`, `fitCover`, `fitContain`, see `scaledFitRects`), and the
downscale happens *during* decoding: a 4000×3000 JPEG headed for a 800×480 panel
never exists at full size. Sampling is box-filtered rather than nearest, in the
row-streamed decoders too (`RowBoxSampler`), and JPEG chroma is interpolated
rather than point-picked, so a heavy downscale does not come out crawling with
aliasing.

**Streaming decoders that never hold the file.** Every scaled decoder has a
pull-source form — `decodePngStreamScaledInto`, `decodeJpegStreamScaledInto`,
`decodeBmpStreamScaledInto`, `decodePpmStreamScaledInto`,
`decodeWebpStreamScaledInto` — driven by an `ImageSourceProc` callback that
hands over the next chunk of input. Feed one from a file and neither the
compressed bytes nor the full-size pixels are ever resident.

**A self-contained streaming inflate** (`pixie/inflatestream.nim`, vendored from
zippy 0.10.16). PNG scanlines leave a fixed ~64KB window as they are produced,
are unfiltered in place, and multi-`IDAT` streams are inflated as segments
rather than concatenated first. The fork depends on stock zippy again as a
result.

**Images that can borrow pixels.** `view(image, x, y, w, h)` is a window onto
another image's memory rather than a copy, with `newImageFrom`,
`toContiguousSeq`, the `forEachSpan` template and `items`/`pairs` iterators as
the seams that keep flat operations fast for owners and correct for views.
`pixelsEqual` compares contents. `Image` is `{.acyclic.}` — load-bearing, not an
optimisation: without it ORC treats every image as a cycle candidate, which
crashes a host that shares images with a dynamically loaded driver.

**SVG that draws text, and draws into your buffer.** `<text>` and `<tspan>`
become glyph outlines and then ordinary paths, so fill, stroke, gradients,
opacity and transforms apply to them exactly as to a `<path>`; font-family
resolution is the application's to answer through `setSvgTypefaceResolver`,
since pixie ships no fonts. `parseSvgXml` parses markup the way `<text>` needs
it. `Svg.renderInto(target)` rasterizes into an image the caller already owns,
which for a caller that has a correctly sized canvas is the difference between
one image and two.

**Color emoji.** COLR/CPAL layered glyphs and CBDT/CBLC and sbix bitmap glyphs
render through `fillText`, with `hasColorGlyph` to ask and `Typeface.fallbacks`
to supply an emoji face behind a text face.

**Text as paths.** `Arrangement.computePath` returns a whole arrangement's
outlines as one path and `Font.baselineOffset` gives the distance from the top
of a typeset block to its first baseline — the two pieces anything that
positions text by its baseline needs.

**Fixes carried here.** EXIF orientation was silently dropped for little-endian
(`II`) JPEGs, which is what most Sony and Canon bodies write, so those photos
decoded sideways. JPEG streaming resync tolerates a window slide.

# Pixie - A full-featured 2D graphics library for Nim.

Pixie is a 2D graphics library similar to [Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/) and [Skia](https://skia.org) written entirely in Nim.

This library is being actively developed and we'd be happy for you to use it.
