## Runtime memory budget for image decoding.
##
## Decoders consult `decodeBudgetBytes` before allocating image-sized
## buffers (coefficient blocks, channel masks, inflate output, pixel seqs)
## and raise a catchable PixieError when a decode would exceed it. The
## budget covers decode *intermediates plus output* for a single decode
## call, not process-wide usage.
##
## 0 means unlimited (upstream pixie behaviour). Embedded builds default
## to a conservative budget; hosts default to unlimited until the
## application calls `setDecodeBudgetBytes` with a live value derived from
## available memory.

## A second, independent limit: the largest SINGLE buffer a decode may
## allocate. The plan budget above answers "can these buffers coexist" —
## a sum over many separate allocations — which is the right question on a
## heap that is merely short, and the wrong one on a heap that is
## fragmented: an ESP32 with 8.6 MB of PSRAM free and a 6 MB largest block
## passed a 5.8 MB plan whose luma channel was one 3.75 MB allocation, then
## died in malloc. Decoders clamp their largest buffer to this and refuse
## (catchably, "memory budget" in the message) when even the clamped plan
## cannot fit. 0 = unlimited.
